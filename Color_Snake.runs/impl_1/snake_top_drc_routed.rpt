2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Snake_position0/Set_Y_reg[6][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Snake_position0/Address_reg[8]_i_2/O, cell Snake_position0/Address_reg[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Snake_position0/Set_Y_reg[6]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Snake_position0/Address_1_reg[8]_i_2/O, cell Snake_position0/Address_1_reg[8]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net key_pro0/k1_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin key_pro0/FSM_sequential_State_Next[1]_i_2/O, cell key_pro0/FSM_sequential_State_Next[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT key_pro0/FSM_sequential_State_Next[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
key_direct0/FSM_sequential_State_Next_reg[0], key_direct0/FSM_sequential_State_Next_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>
